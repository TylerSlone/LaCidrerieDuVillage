This project is a website for the company La Cidrerie Du Village. La Cidrerie Du Village is a store that sells and grows apples, and makes ciders, jellies, and jams. This website is an informative website to showcase to potential customers the products that La Cidrerie Du Village offers.


The three features I have chosen to include are:


1. Creating a responsive navigation menu with CSS.
2. A transition on hover of an element (.8s transition on the left navigation bar link items).
3. A hide/show div located in ciders.html that shows the price of ciders when a specific element is clicked and hides when any other element is clicked.


I have chosen to use the flexbox gap property in this project. https://caniuse.com/flexbox-gap#
